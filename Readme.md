# Storybook issue 10938

Small example for issue https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/10938

## This app was created as following

1. `npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript`

2. `npx -p @storybook/cli@next sb init --type react`

3. Adding a typescript addon, `yarn storybook` now spits out some errors
